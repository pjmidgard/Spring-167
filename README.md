Spring-167


Spring compression algorithm:

Divide by long bits and move 1 bias of 1 bit of bits of information where it is compressed, save 2^64 for 4 GB it is enough to divide 1 if not zero. In the start and on the end divide 2^24-1 but not change numbers and save 2^24 or 2^32 32 bits, dispense size of file. Save it. Save the long information size of the file, save times of compress 1-2^24 save it while we get 2^256 bits. For extract, we need to find information+ what divide plus while we check information compress. 496 bitsÂ± Divide side right save it in left, left side bias data save in right. In the finish add 1 after zero in the left after this 1 like 1, 01, 001, 0001, 00001, 000001, 0000001, 00000001, 000000001. In the end: Count how many times, size of file and number of divided 2^24 or 2^32. Everything is safe. Save every time size of the file and count times to compress: add 1 binary minus 9 or add 0 binary +1 bits, minus -10 or the same size add one or zero.
Example:
How is a file looking:
The divide number 4 bytes, size of file 4 bytes, times of compression 6 bytes, two bias moves of the 64 bits in the start and in the end and compression number.

Procents of maximum Compression: 99.9999985565%
